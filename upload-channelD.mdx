**Best Practices**

- **Optimize Image Size:** Use high-quality but compressed images to prevent slow playback.
- **Keep Branding Consistent:** Add practice logos or colors to maintain professional presentation.
- **Use Scheduling:** Pre-schedule seasonal campaigns (e.g., holiday promotions) for automated publishing.
- **Balance Content:** Mix photos with videos in playlists for variety and engagement.

**Key Notes**

- Uploaded photos are automatically **converted into short video clips** for playlist playback.
- The **minimum display duration** is 10 seconds.
- Uploads are **practice-specific** and do not sync automatically with other practices.
- Scheduling allows you to control when a photo appears and disappears from the playlist.
