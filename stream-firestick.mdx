**Requirements:**

- An Amazon Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Stick 4K.
- A compatible TV with an available HDMI port.
- A Wi-Fi network.
- An Amazon account.

**Plug in Your Fire TV Stick:**

- Insert your Fire TV Stick into an available HDMI port on your TV.
- Connect the Fire TV Stick's USB power cable to a power source. This can be a USB port on your TV if it provides power, or you can use the provided power adapter and plug it into a wall outlet.

**Set Up Your Fire TV Stick:**

- Turn on your TV and switch to the HDMI input where your Fire TV Stick is connected.
- Follow the on-screen instructions. You will be prompted to log into your Amazon account.
- Follow the setup prompts, which will help you connect the Fire TV Stick to your Wi-Fi network.

**Getting the Channel D app**

- Once your Fire TV Stick is set up, open the Amazon App Store app. If the app doesn't appear on the Home screen, search for it in the Search bar.
- In the App Store, search for "Channel D" and download and open the app.
- Enter your Playlist ID. You can find this at the top left of your account.
- Press Play!

**Common Issue 1: "The videos are jumpy"**

Oftentimes, your videos will stop and start multiple times when playing for the first time. This is because the app is downloading each video to your device, and the video is buffering. Once your playlist has played once through, the playback will be smooth.

**Common Issue 2: "My playlist won't loop"**

Sometimes, your playlist will only loop once, and then stop. This is because the "Loop" function is not selected to Loop.

This function sits in between Rewind and Pause on your TV screen, and has three settings: Loop (white), Don't Loop (grey), and Loop Once (white with a 1). Make sure it is set to Loop (white).

**Common Issue 3: "The TV will randomly turn off"**

This is most likely due to your TV having a "Power Saver Mode" switched on. Make sure this is switched off.
