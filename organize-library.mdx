**Step 2: Use Filters**

1. In the **Uploads page**, locate the **Filter options**.
2. Filter media by:
   - **Media Type:** Choose between _Photos_ or _Videos_.
   - **Status:**
     - **Now Playing** → Actively in use in the playlist.
     - **Scheduled** → Set to play in the future.
     - **Paused** → Temporarily disabled from playback.
     - **Draft** → Uploaded but not yet published or added to a playlist.

**Step 3: Sort Media**

1. Use the **Sort option** to organize uploads for easier review.
3. Sort by:
   - **Name** → Alphabetical order (A–Z).
   - **Date** → Chronological order (oldest to newest).

**_Best Practice:_**\_ Sort by **__date__** to quickly find the latest uploaded content.\_

**Part B: Managing Media Items**

**Step 1: Access Media Options**

1. On the **Uploads page**, locate the media item you wish to manage.
2. Hover over the thumbnail.
3. Click the ****three-dot menu (⋮)**** in the lower-right corner.

**Step 2: Manage Media**

From the three-dot menu, you can:

- **Pause** → Temporarily remove the item from active rotation without deleting it.
- **Delete** → Permanently remove the item from the library and any playlists.
- **Edit** → Update details such as title, description, duration (photos), or scheduling (photos/videos).

**Part C: Playlist Connection**

1. Uploaded media (photos and videos) can also appear in your **Playlist section** if added there.
2. To manage placement within the playlist:
   - Go to **Playlist** from the left-hand menu.
   - Drag and drop items to rearrange playback order.
   - Click **Save Changes**, then confirm.
3. The order determines which video or photo plays first during playback.

_Note: Removing media from the playlist does not delete it from the Uploads library._

**Best Practices**

- **Standardize Naming:** Use consistent, descriptive titles for uploads.
- **Regular Clean-Up:** Delete outdated or irrelevant media to keep the library uncluttered.
- **Use Filters Frequently:** Helps quickly locate active vs. scheduled vs. draft content.
- **Check Playlists After Updates:** Always confirm that changes in uploads reflect properly in playlists.

**Key Notes**

- The Upload Library is **practice-specific** — media is not shared across different practices.
- Sorting, filtering, and searching streamline daily content management.
- The **three-dot menu** is the primary tool for editing, pausing, or deleting media.
- Playlist management and Upload Library organization work hand-in-hand for smooth content delivery.
