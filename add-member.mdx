description: "This guide walks you through adding a new team member to your Practice Dashboard. Team members are used to personalize custom videos, ensuring content reflects your actual staff. Follow the steps below to upload a headshot, enter details, and make the team member available for video selections."
---

1. In the Practice/Dashboard tab, scroll down to the Team Members section, click on “Add New”. This will open the New team member popup. 
2. Drag and drop a headshot of your team member. Make sure the minimum resolution is 960 x 960px. The higher the resolution, the better.

Note: it’s not mandatory to upload a team member’s photo, but any video that includes them and their photo will not be put into production until the photo is uploaded.

3. Add their full name. This is how they will appear on the dashboard. 
4. Add their Informal name. This is how their name will appear in their videos. For example, if your team member’s full name is Dr. Jonathan Smith, but is referred to as Dr. Smith, write Dr. Smith. 
5. Add the position they currently hold in the practice.
6. Click “Add new team member”. The team member will now be available for selection when picking custom videos.
