title: "How to Add Videos to Your Channel D Playlist"
description: "This guide explains how to browse the Channel D Video Library and add both instant-play and custom videos to your playlist. You’ll learn how to navigate the library, select videos, customize content when required, and understand where each video appears in your Playlist workflow."
---

1. Navigate to the Library tab on the left of your account.
2. Scroll through the available videos. Use the Category list on the side, or the Search bar at the top to define what you are looking for.
3. When you find a video you like, click on it. This will open up that video's popup.
4. **Instant-play videos** are videos that contain no custom input from you. When you click "Add to Playlist", the video will go into the "Now Playing" column in your Playlist and will play immediately on your TV.
5. **Custom videos** contain a customisation form on the right of the popup. Fill out the required details, then click "Add to playlist". The video will then go into the "In Production" column in the Playlist, meaning our team is now making the custom video for you, and it will be added to the "Now Playing" column when it's done. This process usually takes 24-48 hours.

You can choose as many videos as you'd like, and change them whenever you like.

If you don't see a video that you are looking for, feel free to contact us directly with the suggestion. Our library grows from user requests!
